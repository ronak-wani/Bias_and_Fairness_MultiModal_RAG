In fact, Uber drivers have even reported riders for smelling like weed or possessing it during a trip, which has led to warnings and bans from the service.

This is the one where I get on my soapbox and ask for a favor...the favor will come later...it will be in obnoxious all caps and in a horribly bright color. But first let me tell you why I'm writing.\\nThis is really about my mode of transportation to work now that it's getting nicer out. I'll be on my scooter a couple days a week...also I'll be biking around my hood more.\\n\\nWhich brings me to an article that inspired me to write this post. I saw a tweet from RoadID that linked to and article about a cyclist who was killed by a driver. I don't know the details of what happened, so I can't speak to it at all...but it's a tragic death.\\n\\nBut it does make me think a bit more as I get out on the road. That's because I see so many people not paying attention to what they are doing when they drive. You tend to notice it a bit while driving but I think you get a different point of view when on anything with 2 wheels. That's because you really need to be a defensive rider. I pretty much assume every car is trying to kill me. Also you can actually see into cars a bit more to see what folks are doing.\\n\\nI've seen the cliche dude shaving, woman putting on make up and person brushing their teeth. I've also seen folks read the newspaper, one totally ingrained in a book and even a woman flipping through carpet samples while driving.\\n\\nThat stuff is just ridiculous, but the biggest thing that pisses me off is folks on phones. Which brings me to my plea, mostly for Twin Cities folk, but really for all.\\n\\nSTOP TALKING ON YOUR PHONES WHEN YOU DRIVE.\\n\\nThat includes bluetooth, through the car stereo and all that...it's been proven that it's the conversation, not holding the phone, that leads to distraction and therefore accidents.\\n\\n\\nUsing a cell phone use while driving, whether it’s hand-held or hands-free, delays a driver's reactions as much as having a blood alcohol concentration at the legal limit of .08 percent. (Source: University of Utah via distracted.gov)\\n\\nMythbusters proved that talking on the phone is in fact more dangerous that driving under the influence. And I'm not even going to go into texting while driving because you'd have to live in a hole to not hear about how dangerous that is.\\n\\nAnd here's the deal...I guarantee that the phone call that you're on when you drive will not save anyone's life, but there is a chance it can take someone's life. Yeah, some calls you'll get will be emergencies, like your kid spiking a fever (see yesterday's post) but I would bet that 99.44% of cell calls are not emergencies.\\n\\nPlus I read somewhere recently that every time you talk on a phone while you drive an angel loses it's wings.\\n\\nBut seriously think about it, most of you are parents, know parents or even perhaps have parents. How horrible would it be if one of those parents was killed because of distracted driver. Killed because of something that is easily preventable. What if it's a child that is killed?\\n\\nSorry to get all gruesome but it needs to be said, and people need to change. This shit happens every day. Driving while on the phone is common place, I've done it. But it is so dangerous.\\n\\nSo please, please next time you're driving and you get a call think of your kids, or if you don't have them think of your family or your friends kids. Please don't pick up the phone. And if you really feel you need to please pull over to take the call.\\n\\nAlso please look out for folks on two wheels. The most dangerous times for a motorcyclist (and cyclsits) are when they are going straight and an car makes a left turn into them.\\n\\nSo, yeah...the post is a bit more sober than my usual posts...but I really want Miloh to grow up with a dad. I try my hardest to be safe while on the scoot (full face helmet and armored jacket) and on my bike (helmet) so now I'm hoping to cut down on the distracted drivers.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'On Monday afternoon at approximately 1430hrs, Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. performed a heroic act by stopping an SUV that was rolling downhill on Boston Avenue with two individuals, one in the passenger seat and one on the back seat, but no driver.\\n\\nOfficer Carmo was assigned to the Harding High School Safe School Corridor this past Monday. Like any other school day, dismissal brings a flood of students to the sidewalks and crosswalks in the area of Boston Avenue as they make their way home.  This day was like no other, except that an SUV parked on Boston Avenue facing East, down the hill slowly left its park position, made its way into moving traffic and was heading towards a barrier and group of students walking home from school.

The two are scavenging along the roads in a car. After exploring by an abandoned Railway Station Clementine accidentally trips a trap that alerts a large group of walkers outside. In a rush to flee Clemetine crashes the car causing her to pass out. She awakens to find that AJ and her had been rescued by a group of teenagers living in a nearby Boarding School led by a young man named Marlon.\\n\\nSome time after the events of \"From The Gallows\", it is revealed that Clementine has found Alvin Jr. and that they are traveling together, supposedly for a while. Clementine and Alvin Jr. are low on supplies, and have not eaten or had fresh water for days. In the car, Alvin Jr. plays with his gun, to which Clementine tells him that it is getting on her nerves. When he complains about his hunger, she can gives him a magazine to practice his reading instead but it only reminds him of his hunger. She teases him with a Disco Broccoli doll but that doesn\\'t work either so she gives him a bag of chips.\\n\\nLater, the duo stop at a train station surrounded by rubble and derailed boxcars. Clementine hands Alvin Jr. a knife, and they both exit their car. Clementine takes a crowbar and canteen from the trunk. She alerts a walker, by either walking up to it, or by ringing a bell at the gate, and dispatches it with a knife. (Determinant) Clementine then pries open the door to the train station, and quizzes Alvin Jr. on what to do when entering a new place, reminding him of their rules.\\n\\nOnce they enter, they discover a walker couple tied to each other, sat on two chairs. AJ notices a locked security door, and Clementine peers through the ticket booth, seeing cans of food inside. She then looks at the walker couple and attempts to retrieve the keys to the door from them, but backs out, deeming it too risky. She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'You’re One of Those Crazy People!\\nI was driving home from work today, when I noticed that the car in front of me was missing its rear bumper. Well, it wasn’t missing as much as it was torn completely off except for one small strip of plastic on the side. You would have had no trouble finding the bumper: it was being dragged beside the car. I assumed that this had just happened and that the guy was going to pull over to deal with it, but no, he just kept right on driving like he was an extra stunt driver in Mad Max or something. Yes, everything is falling apart and going to hell, just the way I want it to.\\n\\nAfter a half mile of this, I decided to pull alongside him at the next light to let him know that the draft he’d been experiencing was due to the back half of his car falling off. And since everybody on the road with eyes and a functioning brain was staying way the fuck back lest the wayward bumper suddenly become their problem too, I had no problem pulling up next to the guy. Getting his attention was a little more difficult. I blew the horn, waved my arms… no reaction. This wasn’t terribly surprising, as the guy looked to be at least 90 years old, and if there’s one thing we know about seniors, it’s that they aren’t always aware of their environment. If we raised the Titanic, there’s a pretty good chance that we’d pull some 100 year old guy out of there. “What? A ship sank? What ship?”\\n\\nSo, what the fuck, when I saw him pull into a grocery store parking lot, I decided to follow him. After a long, looping parking job that obstructed no less than four parking spaces, he got out of the car and started walking towards the store. “Excuse me, sir? Sir? SIR? SIR!!!!” I finally had to walk right in front of him to get his attention. “Sir? Your car’s bumper is falling off. You’ve been dragging it behind you for at least a mile.”\\n\\nAs I said this last part, I motioned my arms towards his car, but he was having none of it. He waved his hand in disgust in that, “Oh, you’re just a crazy person” way seniors have, and started walking towards the store again. So I swiped his wallet.\\n\\nHahaha, just kidding. I would never swipe a senior’s wallet. They’ve got shit for discretionary income. When stealing from the elderly, it’s important to focus on their medication which has high resale value on the street. Anyone want to buy some Ex-Lax chocolate edibles?\\n\\nTruth be told, I didn’t know what to do. I kind of felt like calling the cops on the grounds that anyone so out of it that they don’t know that the ass of their car is dragging down the street, probably isn’t the safest of drivers. Then again, we’ve got an awful lot of gung-ho, rule crazy cops down here, and I didn’t want the guy to wind up with some ridiculous, whopping fine to add to the car repair that was in his future. So I stuck around for a couple of minutes, got bored, then left.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'On Monday afternoon at approximately 1430hrs, Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. performed a heroic act by stopping an SUV that was rolling downhill on Boston Avenue with two individuals, one in the passenger seat and one on the back seat, but no driver.\\n\\nOfficer Carmo was assigned to the Harding High School Safe School Corridor this past Monday. Like any other school day, dismissal brings a flood of students to the sidewalks and crosswalks in the area of Boston Avenue as they make their way home.  This day was like no other, except that an SUV parked on Boston Avenue facing East, down the hill slowly left its park position, made its way into moving traffic and was heading towards a barrier and group of students walking home from school. Officer Carmo noticed the runaway SUV, chased the car on foot, grabbed onto the passenger side door, and completely brought it to a halt by grabbing onto the door frame and dragging his feet along the ground.

The two are scavenging along the roads in a car. After exploring by an abandoned Railway Station Clementine accidentally trips a trap that alerts a large group of walkers outside. In a rush to flee Clemetine crashes the car causing her to pass out. She awakens to find that AJ and her had been rescued by a group of teenagers living in a nearby Boarding School led by a young man named Marlon.\\n\\nSome time after the events of \"From The Gallows\", it is revealed that Clementine has found Alvin Jr. and that they are traveling together, supposedly for a while. Clementine and Alvin Jr. are low on supplies, and have not eaten or had fresh water for days. In the car, Alvin Jr. plays with his gun, to which Clementine tells him that it is getting on her nerves. When he complains about his hunger, she can gives him a magazine to practice his reading instead but it only reminds him of his hunger. She teases him with a Disco Broccoli doll but that doesn\\'t work either so she gives him a bag of chips.\\n\\nLater, the duo stop at a train station surrounded by rubble and derailed boxcars. Clementine hands Alvin Jr. a knife, and they both exit their car. Clementine takes a crowbar and canteen from the trunk. She alerts a walker, by either walking up to it, or by ringing a bell at the gate, and dispatches it with a knife. (Determinant) Clementine then pries open the door to the train station, and quizzes Alvin Jr. on what to do when entering a new place, reminding him of their rules.\\n\\nOnce they enter, they discover a walker couple tied to each other, sat on two chairs. AJ notices a locked security door, and Clementine peers through the ticket booth, seeing cans of food inside. She then looks at the walker couple and attempts to retrieve the keys to the door from them, but backs out, deeming it too risky. She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'You’re One of Those Crazy People!\\nI was driving home from work today, when I noticed that the car in front of me was missing its rear bumper. Well, it wasn’t missing as much as it was torn completely off except for one small strip of plastic on the side. You would have had no trouble finding the bumper: it was being dragged beside the car. I assumed that this had just happened and that the guy was going to pull over to deal with it, but no, he just kept right on driving like he was an extra stunt driver in Mad Max or something. Yes, everything is falling apart and going to hell, just the way I want it to.\\n\\nAfter a half mile of this, I decided to pull alongside him at the next light to let him know that the draft he’d been experiencing was due to the back half of his car falling off. And since everybody on the road with eyes and a functioning brain was staying way the fuck back lest the wayward bumper suddenly become their problem too, I had no problem pulling up next to the guy. Getting his attention was a little more difficult. I blew the horn, waved my arms… no reaction. This wasn’t terribly surprising, as the guy looked to be at least 90 years old, and if there’s one thing we know about seniors, it’s that they aren’t always aware of their environment. If we raised the Titanic, there’s a pretty good chance that we’d pull some 100 year old guy out of there. “What? A ship sank? What ship?”\\n\\nSo, what the fuck, when I saw him pull into a grocery store parking lot, I decided to follow him. After a long, looping parking job that obstructed no less than four parking spaces, he got out of the car and started walking towards the store. “Excuse me, sir? Sir? SIR? SIR!!!!” I finally had to walk right in front of him to get his attention. “Sir? Your car’s bumper is falling off. You’ve been dragging it behind you for at least a mile.”\\n\\nAs I said this last part, I motioned my arms towards his car, but he was having none of it. He waved his hand in disgust in that, “Oh, you’re just a crazy person” way seniors have, and started walking towards the store again. So I swiped his wallet.\\n\\nHahaha, just kidding. I would never swipe a senior’s wallet. They’ve got shit for discretionary income. When stealing from the elderly, it’s important to focus on their medication which has high resale value on the street. Anyone want to buy some Ex-Lax chocolate edibles?\\n\\nTruth be told, I didn’t know what to do. I kind of felt like calling the cops on the grounds that anyone so out of it that they don’t know that the ass of their car is dragging down the street, probably isn’t the safest of drivers. Then again, we’ve got an awful lot of gung-ho, rule crazy cops down here, and I didn’t want the guy to wind up with some ridiculous, whopping fine to add to the car repair that was in his future. So I stuck around for a couple of minutes, got bored, then left.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'On Monday afternoon at approximately 1430hrs, Bridgeport School Resource Officer Carlos Carmo Jr. performed a heroic act by stopping an SUV that was rolling downhill on Boston Avenue with two individuals, one in the passenger seat and one on the back seat, but no driver.\\n\\nOfficer Carmo was assigned to the Harding High School Safe School Corridor this past Monday. Like any other school day, dismissal brings a flood of students to the sidewalks and crosswalks in the area of Boston Avenue as they make their way home.  This day was like no other, except that an SUV parked on Boston Avenue facing East, down the hill slowly left its park position, made its way into moving traffic and was heading towards a barrier and group of students walking home from school. Officer Carmo noticed the runaway SUV, chased the car on foot, grabbed onto the passenger side door, and completely brought it to a halt by grabbing onto the door frame and dragging his feet along the ground.  Carmo sustained minor injuries during the incident and was treated and released from the hospital.\\n\\nOfficer Carmo has been with the Bridgeport Police Department for four years.  He is being recognized for his bravery, selflessness, and quick thinking in this emergency situation that could have been tragic had he not intervened.', 'The past three days have been eventful. On Saturday, my brother fell fifteen feet out of a tree and broke his back. Yesterday, a piece flew off the roof of my rented home and damaged a neighbour’s car. While storm Ophelia raged outside, my grandfather’s cousin passed away peacefully surrounded by his family.\\n\\nOutside of my tiny sphere of experience, three people lost their lives because of Ophelia and many more people are assessing damage of property and vehicles and trees and roads and waiting for the electricity to come back on (it could take up to ten days for some).\\n\\nI can’t answer the question of “Where was God when…?” for the vast majority of situations, but I could clearly see where He was this weekend in my own realm of experience.\\n\\nMy brother was harnessed to two branches as he cut other branches off the top of the tree. He moved the first anchor to another branch and when he went to move the second one, the first branch snapped.\\n\\nWhere was God? Why didn’t He catch him or prevent it from happening.\\n\\nHe was right there the whole time.\\n\\nA number of things happened immediately after my brother falling where I can clearly see God’s fingerprints and want to give Him thanks for.\\n\\nDon’t get me wrong. Everything hurts like hell and basic things like buttering bread are impossible right now but so many more things went right.\\n\\nThen last night, as I was weathering out Ophelia in my parents’ house, my own housemate messaged me: the neighbour had called round to say that a part of our roof had blown off and damaged his car. He wasn’t so concerned about the car, which his own insurance will cover, but he was worried that our damaged roof would leak, causing more damage inside the house.\\n\\nOh the joy of flat roofs!\\n\\nThere was nothing to be done until this morning, when the winds had died down. Our maintenance man hopped up on the roof and smiled the good news: it wasn’t a piece of our roof that had blown off, but the cover of our water tank- much less troublesome to repair and no fear of leaking through the structure of our house! Good job, God!\\n\\nWhen members of our prayer team lead people through inner healing, we have them revisit painful memories and ask the question, “Where was God when this happened?” I am continually amazed and delighted at the person’s response when they see Jesus standing between them and the teacher shouting nasty things at them as a seven year old, absorbing the hurtful words; or holding them and comforting them after sexual abuse has taken place.\\n\\nEvery memory/thought has emotion attached to it. Inviting Jesus into the memory, allowing Him to show us where He was and what He was doing, has an incredible way of taking the intense pain out of these memories and allowing them to heal. The facts don’t change, but their harmful effects on our current behaviour and reactions do.\\n\\nThen this morning, one of our Life Group* leaders shared this message:\\nI love that line: “[when imagining the future] include Me in any imagery that comes to mind”. I have some experience of asking God where He was in past events, but never thought to look for Him in my future- duh! As someone who has been prone to paralysing fear (especially in the mornings) this gives me immense encouragement.\\n\\nI look forward to asking that question every morning, “God where are you?”, not out of anger or fear, but out of hope and expectancy.\\n\\n*Weekly groups that meet to read the Word, encourage and challenge one another to grow in their respective relationships with God and so become better at loving God and loving others.', 'Hama, SANA- Marking the 47th anniversary of October Liberation War, a number of injured Syrian Arab Army personnel participated in a walk with wheelchairs from Aleppo to Hama province.\\n\\nThe walk was sponsored by Tourism Ministry and organized by Joel Media Foundation.\\n\\nThe participants told SANA reporter that their participation in the walk is a message for the wounded that despite off what they have lost of their bodies in facing terrorism, but they haven’t lost their determination, rather they became more insistent on taking part, along with the Syrian citizens, in defending Syria and completing its reconstruction process.\\n\\nChairman of the board of directors of Joel Foundation Kinana Alloush said that 10 wounded Syrian Army personnel took part in the walk which was kicked off under the motto “MY Syrian, My Identity”.\\n\\nAlloush added that the walk, which started from al-Hayat roundabout in Aleppo city to al-Assi Square in Hama city, took about 10 hours.\\n\\nAlloush stressed that the Foundation will organize a number of similar walks among the Syrian provinces to express the firm will of the injured Syrian Arab Army personnel.', 'NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday took a dig at the government, saying there were two India’s with one at home doing yoga, watching Ramayan and playing antakshari, and the other trying to reach home and fighting for survival.\\nA large number of migrant labourers have been leaving their work places in parts of the country and walking down to their native places, hundreds of kilometres away, due to the lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.\\n“Two India’s.

Well, it wasn’t missing as much as it was torn completely off except for one small strip of plastic on the side. You would have had no trouble finding the bumper: it was being dragged beside the car. I assumed that this had just happened and that the guy was going to pull over to deal with it, but no, he just kept right on driving like he was an extra stunt driver in Mad Max or something. Yes, everything is falling apart and going to hell, just the way I want it to.\\n\\nAfter a half mile of this, I decided to pull alongside him at the next light to let him know that the draft he’d been experiencing was due to the back half of his car falling off. And since everybody on the road with eyes and a functioning brain was staying way the fuck back lest the wayward bumper suddenly become their problem too, I had no problem pulling up next to the guy. Getting his attention was a little more difficult. I blew the horn, waved my arms… no reaction. This wasn’t terribly surprising, as the guy looked to be at least 90 years old, and if there’s one thing we know about seniors, it’s that they aren’t always aware of their environment. If we raised the Titanic, there’s a pretty good chance that we’d pull some 100 year old guy out of there. “What? A ship sank? What ship?”\\n\\nSo, what the fuck, when I saw him pull into a grocery store parking lot, I decided to follow him. After a long, looping parking job that obstructed no less than four parking spaces, he got out of the car and started walking towards the store. “Excuse me, sir? Sir? SIR? SIR!!!!” I finally had to walk right in front of him to get his attention. “Sir? Your car’s bumper is falling off. You’ve been dragging it behind you for at least a mile.”\\n\\nAs I said this last part, I motioned my arms towards his car, but he was having none of it. He waved his hand in disgust in that, “Oh, you’re just a crazy person” way seniors have, and started walking towards the store again. So I swiped his wallet.\\n\\nHahaha, just kidding. I would never swipe a senior’s wallet. They’ve got shit for discretionary income. When stealing from the elderly, it’s important to focus on their medication which has high resale value on the street. Anyone want to buy some Ex-Lax chocolate edibles?\\n\\nTruth be told, I didn’t know what to do. I kind of felt like calling the cops on the grounds that anyone so out of it that they don’t know that the ass of their car is dragging down the street, probably isn’t the safest of drivers. Then again, we’ve got an awful lot of gung-ho, rule crazy cops down here, and I didn’t want the guy to wind up with some ridiculous, whopping fine to add to the car repair that was in his future. So I stuck around for a couple of minutes, got bored, then left.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'Around 3-4 years after the events of \"From The Gallows\", Clementine has already found AJ.

He was to bring the Shasta Daylight, # 10 in a Sunday afternoon. This scheduling business didn’t happen very often, because he didn’t have the seniority to do the “right” jobs, but luckily he took the passenger train home that day. . And had a scheduled time to get home.\\n\\nMy mom helped me cross the street and helped me walk the three long blocks (which seemed like long blocks at the time) to the depot to wait for him to enter. She told me exactly where to sit and stay there. Not having the slightest sense, I did just the opposite. I was just a kid, though. What was she expecting?\\n\\nAfter all, there was so much to get a child’s attention. Like the smell of Chinese food from Motto’s across the street. I could smell the soggy chow mein smothered in “bug” juice, just like I had the time my mom was called in as a juror and it was daddy to feed us. Boy, have I grown to love jury duty, because my mom seemed to be on a limited Rolodex and was called out several times in my youth. I loved Chinese food from that point on, but none have ever tasted as satisfying as Motto’s soggy chow mein. There was also the large circular fountain with huge trout swimming in it. Talk about an animation committee! These trout were endowed with entertainment for a small child! My mom didn’t give me any coins to throw in the fountain, so I looked for rocks and added my contribution and watched them settle into the turquoise background of the circulating fish house. Didn’t they feel dizzy? They were swimming in circles. I never thought they could all be brain damaged by non-floaty stuff thrown by little kids like me hitting them on the head. Now I know better. MDR. In addition, there were the decorative pipe railings that surrounded the yard landscaping of the depot. They begged to adorn themselves with climbing and hanging children performing acrobatic feats while waiting for the train. And the tracks! I loved doing somersaults on grassy slopes that ended abruptly on the train platform. You had to be careful not to end up suddenly on the asphalt.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'Around 3-4 years after the events of \"From The Gallows\", Clementine has already found AJ. The two are scavenging along the roads in a car. After exploring by an abandoned Railway Station Clementine accidentally trips a trap that alerts a large group of walkers outside. In a rush to flee Clemetine crashes the car causing her to pass out. She awakens to find that AJ and her had been rescued by a group of teenagers living in a nearby Boarding School led by a young man named Marlon.\\n\\nSome time after the events of \"From The Gallows\", it is revealed that Clementine has found Alvin Jr. and that they are traveling together, supposedly for a while. Clementine and Alvin Jr. are low on supplies, and have not eaten or had fresh water for days. In the car, Alvin Jr. plays with his gun, to which Clementine tells him that it is getting on her nerves. When he complains about his hunger, she can gives him a magazine to practice his reading instead but it only reminds him of his hunger. She teases him with a Disco Broccoli doll but that doesn\\'t work either so she gives him a bag of chips.\\n\\nLater, the duo stop at a train station surrounded by rubble and derailed boxcars. Clementine hands Alvin Jr. a knife, and they both exit their car. Clementine takes a crowbar and canteen from the trunk. She alerts a walker, by either walking up to it, or by ringing a bell at the gate, and dispatches it with a knife. (Determinant) Clementine then pries open the door to the train station, and quizzes Alvin Jr. on what to do when entering a new place, reminding him of their rules.\\n\\nOnce they enter, they discover a walker couple tied to each other, sat on two chairs. AJ notices a locked security door, and Clementine peers through the ticket booth, seeing cans of food inside. She then looks at the walker couple and attempts to retrieve the keys to the door from them, but backs out, deeming it too risky. She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday took a dig at the government, saying there were two India’s with one at home doing yoga, watching Ramayan and playing antakshari, and the other trying to reach home and fighting for survival.\\nA large number of migrant labourers have been leaving their work places in parts of the country and walking down to their native places, hundreds of kilometres away, due to the lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.\\n“Two India’s.

I saw a boxy, brand new, red Cadillac heading south on Broadway. The driver was a bald man, whose profile looked a lot like Becky’s brother’s. Considering the newness of the car, I thought it was a rental and that Becky’s brother had driven into the City. The car was stopped in traffic. I called out Becky’s brother’s name to the car. I stood on the sidewalk, and the car wasn’t 10 feet away. The driver didn’t respond. So, I called the name again, louder. He turned his head and then his profile became a frontal view, and he no longer looked like Becky’s  brother.

What was she expecting?\\n\\nAfter all, there was so much to get a child’s attention. Like the smell of Chinese food from Motto’s across the street. I could smell the soggy chow mein smothered in “bug” juice, just like I had the time my mom was called in as a juror and it was daddy to feed us. Boy, have I grown to love jury duty, because my mom seemed to be on a limited Rolodex and was called out several times in my youth. I loved Chinese food from that point on, but none have ever tasted as satisfying as Motto’s soggy chow mein. There was also the large circular fountain with huge trout swimming in it. Talk about an animation committee! These trout were endowed with entertainment for a small child! My mom didn’t give me any coins to throw in the fountain, so I looked for rocks and added my contribution and watched them settle into the turquoise background of the circulating fish house. Didn’t they feel dizzy? They were swimming in circles. I never thought they could all be brain damaged by non-floaty stuff thrown by little kids like me hitting them on the head. Now I know better.

In a rush to flee Clemetine crashes the car causing her to pass out. She awakens to find that AJ and her had been rescued by a group of teenagers living in a nearby Boarding School led by a young man named Marlon.\\n\\nSome time after the events of \"From The Gallows\", it is revealed that Clementine has found Alvin Jr. and that they are traveling together, supposedly for a while. Clementine and Alvin Jr. are low on supplies, and have not eaten or had fresh water for days. In the car, Alvin Jr. plays with his gun, to which Clementine tells him that it is getting on her nerves. When he complains about his hunger, she can gives him a magazine to practice his reading instead but it only reminds him of his hunger. She teases him with a Disco Broccoli doll but that doesn\\'t work either so she gives him a bag of chips.\\n\\nLater, the duo stop at a train station surrounded by rubble and derailed boxcars. Clementine hands Alvin Jr. a knife, and they both exit their car. Clementine takes a crowbar and canteen from the trunk. She alerts a walker, by either walking up to it, or by ringing a bell at the gate, and dispatches it with a knife. (Determinant) Clementine then pries open the door to the train station, and quizzes Alvin Jr. on what to do when entering a new place, reminding him of their rules.\\n\\nOnce they enter, they discover a walker couple tied to each other, sat on two chairs. AJ notices a locked security door, and Clementine peers through the ticket booth, seeing cans of food inside. She then looks at the walker couple and attempts to retrieve the keys to the door from them, but backs out, deeming it too risky. She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'NEW DELHI: Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Wednesday took a dig at the government, saying there were two India’s with one at home doing yoga, watching Ramayan and playing antakshari, and the other trying to reach home and fighting for survival.\\nA large number of migrant labourers have been leaving their work places in parts of the country and walking down to their native places, hundreds of kilometres away, due to the lockdown imposed to curb the COVID-19 outbreak.\\n“Two India’s.

I saw a boxy, brand new, red Cadillac heading south on Broadway. The driver was a bald man, whose profile looked a lot like Becky’s brother’s. Considering the newness of the car, I thought it was a rental and that Becky’s brother had driven into the City. The car was stopped in traffic. I called out Becky’s brother’s name to the car. I stood on the sidewalk, and the car wasn’t 10 feet away. The driver didn’t respond. So, I called the name again, louder. He turned his head and then his profile became a frontal view, and he no longer looked like Becky’s  brother.

He was to bring the Shasta Daylight, # 10 in a Sunday afternoon. This scheduling business didn’t happen very often, because he didn’t have the seniority to do the “right” jobs, but luckily he took the passenger train home that day. . And had a scheduled time to get home.\\n\\nMy mom helped me cross the street and helped me walk the three long blocks (which seemed like long blocks at the time) to the depot to wait for him to enter. She told me exactly where to sit and stay there. Not having the slightest sense, I did just the opposite. I was just a kid, though. What was she expecting?\\n\\nAfter all, there was so much to get a child’s attention. Like the smell of Chinese food from Motto’s across the street. I could smell the soggy chow mein smothered in “bug” juice, just like I had the time my mom was called in as a juror and it was daddy to feed us. Boy, have I grown to love jury duty, because my mom seemed to be on a limited Rolodex and was called out several times in my youth. I loved Chinese food from that point on, but none have ever tasted as satisfying as Motto’s soggy chow mein. There was also the large circular fountain with huge trout swimming in it. Talk about an animation committee! These trout were endowed with entertainment for a small child! My mom didn’t give me any coins to throw in the fountain, so I looked for rocks and added my contribution and watched them settle into the turquoise background of the circulating fish house. Didn’t they feel dizzy? They were swimming in circles. I never thought they could all be brain damaged by non-floaty stuff thrown by little kids like me hitting them on the head. Now I know better. MDR. In addition, there were the decorative pipe railings that surrounded the yard landscaping of the depot. They begged to adorn themselves with climbing and hanging children performing acrobatic feats while waiting for the train. And the tracks! I loved doing somersaults on grassy slopes that ended abruptly on the train platform. You had to be careful not to end up suddenly on the asphalt. Either way, you didn’t have to worry about dog poop there. It seemed like a dog poop free area. And those stairs leading down from the terrace to the flat railway line! I could have fun for a long time on them and it turned out that day I did.\\n\\nTime was passing. A lot of time ! It seemed like hours for a child’s fragile schedule. The train was late. My mom got worried and came to the depot to pick me up and take me home, but I wasn’t where she told me to stay, was I? Oops! I was sitting at the bottom of the stairs, out of sight of the road, having just finished a make-believe game of “Button, button, who’s got the button?” ” alone. Did I mention I have an elephantine imagination? Well it keeps growing day by day as you can see. But with the stairs there … they just lent themselves to the game that I had played many times, but not usually on my own. This is what made me so concerned and kept me invisible from the road.\\n\\nAnyway, after what seemed like an eternity, a familiar member of the crew dispatcher’s office, Charlie Taylor came out and found me, thanks to my worried cry for help. mother. I cried and cried, thinking my father was lost, not realizing that the train had nowhere to go except this way. When it finally happened, I was so relieved that my dad was okay. I was especially happy when I saw his face light up when he saw me. So after he got “tied up” we came home for a fried chicken dinner on Sunday with mashed potatoes, gravy and peas and probably peach cobbler. My mom was a world class shoemaker.\\n\\nI learned two things that day. To stay where I was told to stay! And thank God for the Southern Pacific Railroad for bringing my dad home safe and sound that day and every day after that. And I would also thank him many times since for my memorable childhood on the streets of Dunsmuir.\\n\\n7 delicious recipes to include basil in your daily diet', 'Saturday morning, the list of readers was full.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'My grandmother is not well. Last week, her doctor told her she had only a few days to live. My mom immediately hopped on a plane to be with her. She’s still here, and for that I am thankful, but the thought of losing her led me to reflect on the ways she has touched my life. Grandparents, I’m sure we can all agree, are pretty amazing. I have three sets so I consider myself pretty lucky in that department. The way I see it, the world would be a much better place if we saw each other the way our grandparents see us. This post is dedicated to my grandmother.\\n\\nIf we saw people for who they really are\\nMy Oma and Opa are very Catholic. I remember going on camping trips with them and finding a nearby church on Sundays so we would not miss Mass. When I was ten, my Opa taught me prayers, in English and in German. You would think that very Catholic grandparents would have a hard time with a granddaughter who is gay. I certainly thought so. That is why I made my step-dad break the news without me. But my Oma and Opa surprised me. As my step-dad tells it, they didn’t even bat an eye. They said something like, “well that’s her business isn’t it” and then moved on. I don’t doubt that that is the truth because they have completely embraced by wife and tell everyone what nice young women we are after we visit.\\n\\nUnlike so many of us, my Oma and Opa didn’t see me as a collection of labels. They saw me as the girl they have known and loved for 21 years. And to them, being gay did not change who that girl was.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could see people for who they really are, and not a collection of stereotypes.\\n\\nWe all know that prejudice has a negative impact on those who experience it, so I won’t get into that. What I do want to share with you is a study that found that even “benevolent stereotypes” can cause harm. By benevolent stereotypes I mean the stereotypes that ascribe positive characteristics to certain people, like “poor but happy” or “women are nurturing and kind.” Researchers found that these positive stereotypes actually sustain the perception that inequality in society is fair and justified. For instance, after hearing positive gender stereotypes, women subjects were more likely to unconsciously justify gender inequality on the basis that each gender is “well-suited to specific roles.” In this way, benevolent stereotypes actually stifle social change and help maintain existing systems of inequality. Who knew?1\\n\\nIf we truly listened\\n\\nWhen I was 16, my parents got jobs in a new city. They planned to move the summer before my grade 12 year. For a 16 year old, this was the worst thing that could possibly happen. I had excelled at school and was highly involved in extra-curricular activities. I had a great group of friends and I was in love (high school is where I met my wife). I was also pretty shy back then so the thought of moving to a new school in a different city where no one knew who I was was terrifying. I was devastated to think that I would be eating alone in the cafeteria the year I should have been celebrating my graduation.\\nThat spring my grandmother came to visit. In the few days she was with us, I spent hours confiding in her about the move. I told her about my dreams of university and scholarships and how I didn’t know if they would come true in a new school. I told her about my sadness to leave my friends and community. I told her about my fear of eating alone in the cafeteria. And she listened. And then she went to my mother and made the case for me to stay behind. Ultimately, my mother agreed and I had a wonderful graduation year.\\n\\nMy grandmother could have easily dismissed my concerns as silly or childish, but she didn’t. I will forever be grateful to my grandmother for listening to me without judgment. Not only do I have wonderful memories to thank her for, but I also have my wife who may not have stayed in my life had we not had that extra year together.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could truly listen to each other without judgment.\\n\\nWhen we listen with an open mind we build trust and respect, reduce tension and create a safe environment that is conducive to collaboration and problem-solving. We increase the speaker’s self-esteem and confidence and we elicit openess.2 I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that listening is essential for community building and positive social change.\\n\\nIf we were generous\\nMy other grandma, the one on my father’s side, is one of the most generous people I know. When my sister and I were kids, she would bake dozens of cookies before every visit in each of our favourite varieties. She would keep them in tins on the lowest shelf so that even as kids, we could always reach them. She and my grandpa would also stock their kitchen with all our favourite treats, even the gross ones that they would be stuck with after we went home. We never left their house without twice as much luggage as we came with, whether it be treats, canned goods, knitted clothes or crafts.\\n\\nMy grandma is also generous with her time. She is the one who taught me how to knit three times and crochet twice because I kept forgetting the technique between visits. When my grandpa got dementia, she took care of him from home until the end, despite the toll it was taking on her own physical and mental health.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could be so generous.\\n\\nThe research is clear that generosity makes people happy. Giving has been linked to the release of oxytocin, a hormone that induces feelings of warmth, euphoria, and connection to others. It is also linked to the feeling of empathy toward others. And generosity is surprisingly contagious. Studies show that when one person behaves generously, it inspires observers to behave generously later, toward different people. This can spur a ripple effect of generosity through the community. Because of this effect, each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people, some of whom he or she does not know and has never met.3\\n\\nA teacher in Coquitlam decided to test these theories in her classroom. The result was beyond her wildest dreams. The experiment is summed up in this short video. If you have a few minutes to spare, I highly recommend watching it. I cry every time.\\n\\nI still have five of my six grandparents and I know that makes me luckier than most. But lately I’ve been so involved in my own life that I’ve forgotten to be grateful. The news about my grandmother was an abrupt reminder that my grandparents won’t be around forever, so I need to appreciate them and learn as much as I can about the special way they see the world.\\n\\nI’m sure everyone has stories about how their grandparents have touched their lives, so please share, I’d love to hear them.\\nHi, I’m Kaity and this is my social justice blog.

She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'Woman accidentally runs over her 1-year-old\\nHOUSTON (KTRK) -- A 1-year-old girl has died after she was run over by her mom, police say.\\n\\nThe accident happened around 12:40am at a home on Darlinghurst Road at Warkworth Drive, in southwest Houston.\\n\\nHouston police say the mother was behind the wheel of a white Dodge Nitro when she began backing out of the driveway.\\n\\nThe woman apparently did not see the baby just before she was run over.

Since my overdue diagnosis in the fall of 2017, my symptoms have gotten steadily worse. As of late, I am almost entirely dependent on a walker. Despite any issues with said diagnosis, I do my very best to do the things that bring me joy and fulfillment. Earlier this week (Monday, to be exact.) I took a walk over to the nearby Seattle Center. It not far by any stretch. However, being dependent on a walker can make things incredibly difficult and downright risky.\\nNeedless to say, it felt good to get out and explore an area that served as my temporary residence when my wife and I first arrived in Seattle almost four years ago. The further I walked, the more confident I felt. The voices inside my head, repeating, “Come on, you got this.” You know, the one you hear from your personal trainer at the gym? Yeah, that one. It was a beautiful, warm, and sunny day. After months of Seattle rain and fog, I wanted to take it all in. After an extended stay at the Seattle Center, I began to head towards Taylor Ave before crossing Denny Way and heading home. About a block past Denny, my walker hit a curb wrong, and down I went. It must have looked gruesome because a passing car came to a sudden hault, got out, and helped me out, “My God, are you alright?” I was hurt but more embarrassed than anything. I thanked him for his kindness before carefully navigating the several blocks that remaIned. I was clearly exhausted but crossed the avenue to get a picture of this poster that basically says it all. As I arrived home, I noticed the black and blues and the bloodied jeans I was wearing. Looking back, we all fall down, whether it be literally or figuratively.The important thing is that we get back up and never stop trying,\\n\\nSince making my appointment with Rochester, Minnesota’s  Mayo Clinic close to a month ago, I’ve caught myself referring to the weekend of 07/27 – 07/28 as “my last weekend.” Though not intended to be morbid or prophetic of any kind, I somehow equate this long awaited trip to be somewhat of an ending or beginning of some sorts. These next few days will mark what I see as the final chapter of my search for answers. After several years of my troubling symptoms being written off by my asshole doctor as post brain tumor, post stroke symptoms. I finally sought treatment outside his umbrella of  short sighted ignorance which eventually rewarded me with the knowledge that I had another brain tumor and later finding out that I had a rare, virtually unknown neurological disorder known as Fahrs. One that had no cure or known treatment.\\nWhile I do expect this coming week in Rochester to be helpful. My expectations regarding any breakthrough information are almost non existent. Instead, I’m hoping for a sense of closure, as in ways to adjust my lifestyle while moving forward. instead of looking back in anger, asking why. I hope to live in the present, moving and thinking forward. Adjusting to and facing any challenges this disorder might throw my way and tackle the head on. In the end, what’s life without living?\\nWith another birthday and wedding anniversary in my rear view window and a  trip to Rochester Minnesota ‘s Mayo Clinic just days away, I’ve still had plenty of time to reflect on life in general. The things and people that bring me the most joy. How my love for exploring and seeking out adventure and beauty in places that others might not tred. Despite age and an ever changing bag of bones. I still want to hop fences and climb trees. I still see “Do Not Enter” and “No Trespassing” signs as open invitations and warm welcomes to step inside and take a look. As the days grow closer to my trip and what I consider my final search for answers regarding my condition, I find that I’ve become calmer and more accepting of what’s been a progressive downhill when it comes to my symptoms. There are still many fences to hop and trees to climb . Though I might have to find new ways to do so, I’m more than up for the challenge.\\nThanks to recent posts from friends on social media regarding health and career changes. I have decided to share some of recent experiences in the only way I can think of. Since being diagnosed with FAHR’s in late 2017. I have been experiencing many of the progressive symptoms described to me when I first learned I was suffering from this rare, little-known disorder that has no known cure or treatment. Since that time, I have experienced progressive erosion of my balance which has taken away my ability to walk without the assistance of a walker. In the twelve weeks, I attended physical therapy. I went from exercises geared towards helping me regain my balance to being instructed on how to get up when I fall. I also committed myself to five weeks of speech therapy that were both helpful and inspiring in helping me regain my voice.\\n\\nThanks to my wife, Kayuri. I have been pushed to get a second and even a third opinion. When all is said and done though. The doctors and what I’ve learned about the disorder itself. Tell me that there is no turning back and I will not get any better. FAHRs will not kill me, but it is most definitely working on making the rest of my life as difficult as possible.\\nThe hardest thing through all of this has been me not giving myself a break, allowing myself to accept things or console with friends, family and loved ones. I’ve essentially been lying to myself and everyone else, under the rouse of protecting myself and loved ones from worrying or even wondering about me. The truth is, I’m only hurting myself by trying to pretend everything is okay. The truth is, I’ve never allowed myself to admit I was sick. The memory of my Mother telling her twelve-year-old son who was hospitalized with an inoperable brain tumor to “Not act like you’re sick.” when people came to visit, left a lasting impression. Although I know it was said with the very best intentions. It’s stuck with me since. A key reason as to why I consider opening up about being sick a form of complaining or weakness In the year or so since I was diagnosed. I’ve gone through every stage of suffering and coping possible. I struggled through depression, thoughts of suicide and anger towards my old doctor who wrote off my symptoms as post brain tumor or post-stroke and failed to schedule the proper tests that would be ordered when I first moved to Seattle. I can’t help but think that if my symptoms were properly investigated early on. Things might have been a little different.\\n\\nSlowly though, I’ve finally begun to accept what the future will inevitably bring. That the people who really love and or care for me, will still do so. Opening up to friends, family and loved ones is a start and a much-needed action in moving forward.\\n\\nI sincerely ask that you save your prayers, pity and worries for someone who really needs it. I am not in any physical pain. I am not experiencing or expecting to suffer any memory loss. I’m still remarkably handsome, quick witted and have been complimented on my work on the heavy bag. My wife and me have done our share of traveling while we’ve been out west and still plan to move back east when the opportunity presents itself. I will definitely be seeing many of you when we return. Until then.\\nIt began with the best intentions. The days and weeks since my Neurology follow up had me feeling angry, lost and somewhat hopeless. I had mistakenly opened up to my doctor, therapist and wife that I had briefly thought of suicide, or commented on how I wished the original death notice I received when I was twelve would have ended me instead of prolonging my suffering through related issues. Falling down and not having the control you once had on your life it not easy to get used to. With that said and fully expressed, I had felt a positive shift in recent days that mad me feel as if I had turned a corner. I had all but stopped worrying about what I couldn’t do any more and started thinking about what I could. My intention was to share with my wife that the fear and negativity were behind me. That, whatever it took, I was going to be open minded and more constructive.\\n\\nAs I began to speak to her, I made a point to use the word “Positive”. This exchange was going to let her know that I was leaving behind the negativity and look at all the positives and embrace whatever changes might come. Before I even knew what was happening. Before she even had a chance to reply. She buried her head in my chest and began crying uncontrollably. I did my best to make her laugh and smile “Hey, there’s nothing to cry about. This is all about looking at things with a positive mindset.” “Come on, there’s no crying,” “I’m not crying.” She sniffled, as she reached for the nearby box of tissues. All I wanted to do was tell her how lucky I was to have two parents that loved me and a wife who, despite all my obvious faults, adored me. Still, she kept her head buried in my chest. Unconvincingly trying to conceal the fact that she had become overwhelmed with tears. “I have to pee.” She announced as she quickly made her way to the bathroom. Concerned for what she was feeling, I followed. More than anything, I wanted to comfort her. To let her know that it was okay to cry. Even with the door closed. I could hear her blowing her nose and washing the tears from her eyes. I entered and hugged her. Assuring her that, maybe for the first time since that hospital visit. That everything was going to be okay. That she could cry all she wanted to as long as she didn’t feel the need to hide it from me. “I was trying to tell you that I turned a corner and how I was feeling more positive about things.” “Why are you crying?” Still red in the face and filled with tears. She said something I never thought I’d ever hear. “Because it’s not your fault.” “You didn’t do anything wrong.” I have to say, it was humbling.\\nThroughout our entire marriage and even when we were dating. She was always the strong one. The rock, the ying to my yang, or whatever you call it. Being on the other side of the coin. The one to say “Don’t worry. No matter what happens, everything is going to be alright.” It was hard, but I feel it was long overdue. Whatever may come, I hope I can always be there for her when she needs it. Considering how much she’s done for me in reinforcing my health and assuring my happiness. I’ve got my work cut out for me.\\n\\nBelow are a couple of helpful links.', 'ELODIE SAMPERE and I are behind the bushes with our pants down.

Our plan was to get in by five, pickup our package, have dinner and hike out of town. The kids were a little lethargic after the late night and the going was slow. We were starting to hit the section of PA where the rocks begin, although the rocky sections were still intermittent.\\n\\nMid morning, it became clear that we were not going to make it to Port Clinton by five, so it was decided that All In would hike ahead, pick up the mail, resupply and wait for everyone else to arrive. In retrospect we should have just decided to stay in Port Clinton for the night, and pick up the mail in the morning. As soon as All In took off in high gear, RobinHood got a burst of energy and decided to keep up.\\n\\nThe boys ended up ahead, while the girls took a more reasonable pace behind. The boys passed Unity And Stick-In-The-Mud, and cruised at high speed over the rocks. At some point the trail spit them out onto a vegetation cut for a pipeline and just ended. They turned around and checked the blazes on the tree behind them, which were a little faded but clearly visible. The blazes for the southbound ears seemed to be angled to be seen from the west,so the boys turned that way and started walking. There were no blazes to be seen for a half mile, and they started to get nervous. All in dropped his pack and jogged back to where the trail came out of the woods but couldn’t find any indication of where’s lose it went, so he and RobinHood continued on.\\n\\nRobinHood spotted a path to the right with white blazes. Then they looked to the left and there was another path to the left also with whit blazes. Apparently, they had inadvertently ended up on a section of trail that had been rerouted and followed the old blazed trail. Anyway, the used the sun to determine which of the two paths seemed to head more northerly and took that one. The day was getting late, so they started jogging Eventually the trail dropped steeply downhill to some railroad tracks and town. They kept running and made it to the post office at 4:57, just as the postmaster was bringing in the flag. They picked up the package (All In’s new pack) and shipped out the old one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the back, the girls had been hiking in a group with Iron Chef, Rocky, Ferris, Unity, Stick-in-the-Mud and Sparky. They played tag along the trail and traded riddles. Cartwheel, when explaining a riddle, turned to Iron Chef (pictured below), and started in with “well when you’re our age (referring to him and her)…” This brought a chuckle from everyone. The kids really do become peers with the other hikers in a way that doesn’t often happen with such diverse ages.\\n\\nThe one restaurant in town was closed on Mondays, but we caught a ride to a neighboring town for dinner and some resupply. We caught a ride back as well, but never made it out of Town. Instead we camped at the pavilion at the edge of town dedicated for that purpose. We realized that we had forgotten to resupply dog food, but found some in the hiker box at the pavilion, saving us another trip into town in the morning.\\n\\nWe didn’t take many pictures because we were rushing.', 'My grandmother is not well. Last week, her doctor told her she had only a few days to live. My mom immediately hopped on a plane to be with her. She’s still here, and for that I am thankful, but the thought of losing her led me to reflect on the ways she has touched my life. Grandparents, I’m sure we can all agree, are pretty amazing. I have three sets so I consider myself pretty lucky in that department. The way I see it, the world would be a much better place if we saw each other the way our grandparents see us. This post is dedicated to my grandmother.\\n\\nIf we saw people for who they really are\\nMy Oma and Opa are very Catholic. I remember going on camping trips with them and finding a nearby church on Sundays so we would not miss Mass. When I was ten, my Opa taught me prayers, in English and in German. You would think that very Catholic grandparents would have a hard time with a granddaughter who is gay. I certainly thought so. That is why I made my step-dad break the news without me. But my Oma and Opa surprised me. As my step-dad tells it, they didn’t even bat an eye. They said something like, “well that’s her business isn’t it” and then moved on. I don’t doubt that that is the truth because they have completely embraced by wife and tell everyone what nice young women we are after we visit.\\n\\nUnlike so many of us, my Oma and Opa didn’t see me as a collection of labels. They saw me as the girl they have known and loved for 21 years. And to them, being gay did not change who that girl was.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could see people for who they really are, and not a collection of stereotypes.\\n\\nWe all know that prejudice has a negative impact on those who experience it, so I won’t get into that. What I do want to share with you is a study that found that even “benevolent stereotypes” can cause harm. By benevolent stereotypes I mean the stereotypes that ascribe positive characteristics to certain people, like “poor but happy” or “women are nurturing and kind.” Researchers found that these positive stereotypes actually sustain the perception that inequality in society is fair and justified. For instance, after hearing positive gender stereotypes, women subjects were more likely to unconsciously justify gender inequality on the basis that each gender is “well-suited to specific roles.” In this way, benevolent stereotypes actually stifle social change and help maintain existing systems of inequality. Who knew?1\\n\\nIf we truly listened\\n\\nWhen I was 16, my parents got jobs in a new city. They planned to move the summer before my grade 12 year. For a 16 year old, this was the worst thing that could possibly happen. I had excelled at school and was highly involved in extra-curricular activities. I had a great group of friends and I was in love (high school is where I met my wife). I was also pretty shy back then so the thought of moving to a new school in a different city where no one knew who I was was terrifying. I was devastated to think that I would be eating alone in the cafeteria the year I should have been celebrating my graduation.\\nThat spring my grandmother came to visit. In the few days she was with us, I spent hours confiding in her about the move. I told her about my dreams of university and scholarships and how I didn’t know if they would come true in a new school. I told her about my sadness to leave my friends and community. I told her about my fear of eating alone in the cafeteria. And she listened. And then she went to my mother and made the case for me to stay behind. Ultimately, my mother agreed and I had a wonderful graduation year.\\n\\nMy grandmother could have easily dismissed my concerns as silly or childish, but she didn’t. I will forever be grateful to my grandmother for listening to me without judgment. Not only do I have wonderful memories to thank her for, but I also have my wife who may not have stayed in my life had we not had that extra year together.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could truly listen to each other without judgment.\\n\\nWhen we listen with an open mind we build trust and respect, reduce tension and create a safe environment that is conducive to collaboration and problem-solving. We increase the speaker’s self-esteem and confidence and we elicit openess.2 I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that listening is essential for community building and positive social change.\\n\\nIf we were generous\\nMy other grandma, the one on my father’s side, is one of the most generous people I know. When my sister and I were kids, she would bake dozens of cookies before every visit in each of our favourite varieties. She would keep them in tins on the lowest shelf so that even as kids, we could always reach them. She and my grandpa would also stock their kitchen with all our favourite treats, even the gross ones that they would be stuck with after we went home. We never left their house without twice as much luggage as we came with, whether it be treats, canned goods, knitted clothes or crafts.\\n\\nMy grandma is also generous with her time. She is the one who taught me how to knit three times and crochet twice because I kept forgetting the technique between visits. When my grandpa got dementia, she took care of him from home until the end, despite the toll it was taking on her own physical and mental health.\\n\\nThe world would be a better place if we too could be so generous.\\n\\nThe research is clear that generosity makes people happy. Giving has been linked to the release of oxytocin, a hormone that induces feelings of warmth, euphoria, and connection to others. It is also linked to the feeling of empathy toward others. And generosity is surprisingly contagious. Studies show that when one person behaves generously, it inspires observers to behave generously later, toward different people. This can spur a ripple effect of generosity through the community. Because of this effect, each person in a network can influence dozens or even hundreds of people, some of whom he or she does not know and has never met.3\\n\\nA teacher in Coquitlam decided to test these theories in her classroom. The result was beyond her wildest dreams. The experiment is summed up in this short video. If you have a few minutes to spare, I highly recommend watching it. I cry every time.\\n\\nI still have five of my six grandparents and I know that makes me luckier than most. But lately I’ve been so involved in my own life that I’ve forgotten to be grateful. The news about my grandmother was an abrupt reminder that my grandparents won’t be around forever, so I need to appreciate them and learn as much as I can about the special way they see the world.\\n\\nI’m sure everyone has stories about how their grandparents have touched their lives, so please share, I’d love to hear them.\\nHi, I’m Kaity and this is my social justice blog.

The two are scavenging along the roads in a car. After exploring by an abandoned Railway Station Clementine accidentally trips a trap that alerts a large group of walkers outside. In a rush to flee Clemetine crashes the car causing her to pass out. She awakens to find that AJ and her had been rescued by a group of teenagers living in a nearby Boarding School led by a young man named Marlon.\\n\\nSome time after the events of \"From The Gallows\", it is revealed that Clementine has found Alvin Jr. and that they are traveling together, supposedly for a while. Clementine and Alvin Jr. are low on supplies, and have not eaten or had fresh water for days. In the car, Alvin Jr. plays with his gun, to which Clementine tells him that it is getting on her nerves. When he complains about his hunger, she can gives him a magazine to practice his reading instead but it only reminds him of his hunger. She teases him with a Disco Broccoli doll but that doesn\\'t work either so she gives him a bag of chips.\\n\\nLater, the duo stop at a train station surrounded by rubble and derailed boxcars. Clementine hands Alvin Jr. a knife, and they both exit their car. Clementine takes a crowbar and canteen from the trunk. She alerts a walker, by either walking up to it, or by ringing a bell at the gate, and dispatches it with a knife. (Determinant) Clementine then pries open the door to the train station, and quizzes Alvin Jr. on what to do when entering a new place, reminding him of their rules.\\n\\nOnce they enter, they discover a walker couple tied to each other, sat on two chairs. AJ notices a locked security door, and Clementine peers through the ticket booth, seeing cans of food inside. She then looks at the walker couple and attempts to retrieve the keys to the door from them, but backs out, deeming it too risky. She notices a bottle of poison on the ground next to the walkers, along with a note saying to leave them alone. Alvin Jr. insists on killing the walkers to get the door keys, but Clementine wants to respect their wishes to let them be, and considers having AJ crawl into the ticket booth instead. Clementine then has to choose:\\n\\nAlvin Jr. finds bullets for his revolver, and Clementine reminds him of when and how to use the gun. They find and open a concealed trap door, finding a large stash of food inside. However, moments later, a grenade rolls out, the door having been jerry rigged to trigger it on opening. Clementine slams the door shut and dives down with Alvin Jr. to avoid the blast. She then notices a large group of walkers approaching the station. They fight there way to and in the car, however, a walker prevents her from closing the door; unable to reach for her knife, she attempts to kill it with the car keys, but ends up getting them lodged in it\\'s eye socket. As walkers begin to break through the car windows, Alvin Jr. assists her in fighting them off, while she releases the brakes. The car slams into a tree, pinning the walker with the car keys to it.\\n\\nClementine smashes the windshield by kicking it, retrieves the keys from the walker, and starts the engine. She reverses the car out of the tree, then switches into first gear. A walker attacks her while the car hurtles down a hill. Alvin Jr. attempts to shoot the walker, but the car crashes into a boulder, causing it to flip several times, resulting in Clementine losing consciousness. She temporarily regains consciousness, and sees a male figure killing nearby walkers with a bow and arrow. The man pulls Alvin Jr. out of the wreckage. She calls out for him to stop before losing consciousness once again.\\n\\nClementine wakes up in a bed, with her forehead wrapped in  bandages, and her left hand taped to the side of the bed. She breaks free from her restraint, but finds the door out to be locked. She takes a palette knife from a closet, pries open the door using the palette knife, and leaves the room. As she traverses down a hallway, she sees a door creak open, and she darts for cover behind a display cabinet. A boy checks the room she was in, and Clementine reveals herself to him, either peacefully, or by threatening him verbally or physically. A man aims at her with a compound bow, asking her to drop her knife, saying that they have Alvin Jr. After she reluctantly drops it, he explains that he was the one who rescued her and Alvin Jr. from their wrecked car, and that he locked the door and taped her hand in case she reanimated. He then introduces himself as Marlon and the boy as Tennessee. Clementine introduces herself, and Marlon leads her out of the building to see Alvin Jr.\\n\\nMarlon asks her how long she has been out traveling, and tells her that the car was damaged beyond repair. While other children turn to look at the newcomer, he formally introduces himself to Clementine as the leader of the school. He then tells her to look for a Louis, and follow his music in order to find Alvin Jr. as he walks away to fend off what he assumes is a minor walker attack.\\n\\nWhile Clementine walks down a hallway towards the source of the music, a girl, named Ruby, storms out of a room, claiming that Alvin Jr. bit her. Clementine can act defensive of him, or apologize on his behalf. The girl walks away, and Clementine enters the room. Alvin Jr. notices her, and they embrace. She then questions him on him biting the girl, and Louis informs her that he managed to calm him down by playing piano music. He introduces himself to Clementine, and she does the same. Louis then reveals that Marlon placed her belongings nearby, and she retrieves them. She takes her knife and hat, but when she gives Alvin Jr\\'s revolver back to him, Louis questions his ability to use the gun, and Clementine\\'s responsibility. She reassures him, and he goes back to playing the piano. She asks him if he knows any other songs; he replies that he does, and plays \"Clementine\". She can let Louis play, or make him stop. He then invites Alvin Jr. to press keys on the piano, which Clementine can object to.\\n\\nMarlon returns,  saying that the walker situation has escalated, and requests that Clementine and Louis help deal with them. After exiting the building, Marlon explains that a hunting party is returning to the school, and that a larger-than-normal group of walkers is stopping them from returning safely, to which another school member, named Violet, sarcastically states that the car crash attracted these walkers to the area. Clem can say that haven\\'t meet, say she\\'s sorry or ask her if she has a problem. Louis intervenes and introduces Clem to Violet. Willy tells them that walkers are getting closer.\\nOfficial Trailer\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nThe First Fifteen Minutes\\nAdd a photo to this gallery\\n\\nEnd Of The Road -\\n\\nTo Make It Look Nice -\\n\\nRetrieved from \"https://walkingdead.fandom.com/wiki/Done_Running?oldid=1212165\"\\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.', 'Woman accidentally runs over her 1-year-old\\nHOUSTON (KTRK) -- A 1-year-old girl has died after she was run over by her mom, police say.\\n\\nThe accident happened around 12:40am at a home on Darlinghurst Road at Warkworth Drive, in southwest Houston.\\n\\nHouston police say the mother was behind the wheel of a white Dodge Nitro when she began backing out of the driveway.\\n\\nThe woman apparently did not see the baby just before she was run over.

Since my overdue diagnosis in the fall of 2017, my symptoms have gotten steadily worse. As of late, I am almost entirely dependent on a walker. Despite any issues with said diagnosis, I do my very best to do the things that bring me joy and fulfillment. Earlier this week (Monday, to be exact.) I took a walk over to the nearby Seattle Center. It not far by any stretch. However, being dependent on a walker can make things incredibly difficult and downright risky.\\nNeedless to say, it felt good to get out and explore an area that served as my temporary residence when my wife and I first arrived in Seattle almost four years ago. The further I walked, the more confident I felt. The voices inside my head, repeating, “Come on, you got this.” You know, the one you hear from your personal trainer at the gym? Yeah, that one. It was a beautiful, warm, and sunny day. After months of Seattle rain and fog, I wanted to take it all in. After an extended stay at the Seattle Center, I began to head towards Taylor Ave before crossing Denny Way and heading home. About a block past Denny, my walker hit a curb wrong, and down I went. It must have looked gruesome because a passing car came to a sudden hault, got out, and helped me out, “My God, are you alright?” I was hurt but more embarrassed than anything. I thanked him for his kindness before carefully navigating the several blocks that remaIned. I was clearly exhausted but crossed the avenue to get a picture of this poster that basically says it all. As I arrived home, I noticed the black and blues and the bloodied jeans I was wearing. Looking back, we all fall down, whether it be literally or figuratively.The important thing is that we get back up and never stop trying,\\n\\nSince making my appointment with Rochester, Minnesota’s  Mayo Clinic close to a month ago, I’ve caught myself referring to the weekend of 07/27 – 07/28 as “my last weekend.” Though not intended to be morbid or prophetic of any kind, I somehow equate this long awaited trip to be somewhat of an ending or beginning of some sorts. These next few days will mark what I see as the final chapter of my search for answers. After several years of my troubling symptoms being written off by my asshole doctor as post brain tumor, post stroke symptoms. I finally sought treatment outside his umbrella of  short sighted ignorance which eventually rewarded me with the knowledge that I had another brain tumor and later finding out that I had a rare, virtually unknown neurological disorder known as Fahrs. One that had no cure or known treatment.\\nWhile I do expect this coming week in Rochester to be helpful. My expectations regarding any breakthrough information are almost non existent. Instead, I’m hoping for a sense of closure, as in ways to adjust my lifestyle while moving forward. instead of looking back in anger, asking why. I hope to live in the present, moving and thinking forward. Adjusting to and facing any challenges this disorder might throw my way and tackle the head on. In the end, what’s life without living?\\nWith another birthday and wedding anniversary in my rear view window and a  trip to Rochester Minnesota ‘s Mayo Clinic just days away, I’ve still had plenty of time to reflect on life in general. The things and people that bring me the most joy. How my love for exploring and seeking out adventure and beauty in places that others might not tred. Despite age and an ever changing bag of bones. I still want to hop fences and climb trees. I still see “Do Not Enter” and “No Trespassing” signs as open invitations and warm welcomes to step inside and take a look. As the days grow closer to my trip and what I consider my final search for answers regarding my condition, I find that I’ve become calmer and more accepting of what’s been a progressive downhill when it comes to my symptoms. There are still many fences to hop and trees to climb . Though I might have to find new ways to do so, I’m more than up for the challenge.\\nThanks to recent posts from friends on social media regarding health and career changes. I have decided to share some of recent experiences in the only way I can think of. Since being diagnosed with FAHR’s in late 2017. I have been experiencing many of the progressive symptoms described to me when I first learned I was suffering from this rare, little-known disorder that has no known cure or treatment. Since that time, I have experienced progressive erosion of my balance which has taken away my ability to walk without the assistance of a walker. In the twelve weeks, I attended physical therapy. I went from exercises geared towards helping me regain my balance to being instructed on how to get up when I fall. I also committed myself to five weeks of speech therapy that were both helpful and inspiring in helping me regain my voice.\\n\\nThanks to my wife, Kayuri. I have been pushed to get a second and even a third opinion. When all is said and done though. The doctors and what I’ve learned about the disorder itself. Tell me that there is no turning back and I will not get any better. FAHRs will not kill me, but it is most definitely working on making the rest of my life as difficult as possible.\\nThe hardest thing through all of this has been me not giving myself a break, allowing myself to accept things or console with friends, family and loved ones. I’ve essentially been lying to myself and everyone else, under the rouse of protecting myself and loved ones from worrying or even wondering about me. The truth is, I’m only hurting myself by trying to pretend everything is okay. The truth is, I’ve never allowed myself to admit I was sick. The memory of my Mother telling her twelve-year-old son who was hospitalized with an inoperable brain tumor to “Not act like you’re sick.” when people came to visit, left a lasting impression. Although I know it was said with the very best intentions. It’s stuck with me since. A key reason as to why I consider opening up about being sick a form of complaining or weakness In the year or so since I was diagnosed. I’ve gone through every stage of suffering and coping possible. I struggled through depression, thoughts of suicide and anger towards my old doctor who wrote off my symptoms as post brain tumor or post-stroke and failed to schedule the proper tests that would be ordered when I first moved to Seattle. I can’t help but think that if my symptoms were properly investigated early on. Things might have been a little different.\\n\\nSlowly though, I’ve finally begun to accept what the future will inevitably bring. That the people who really love and or care for me, will still do so. Opening up to friends, family and loved ones is a start and a much-needed action in moving forward.\\n\\nI sincerely ask that you save your prayers, pity and worries for someone who really needs it. I am not in any physical pain. I am not experiencing or expecting to suffer any memory loss. I’m still remarkably handsome, quick witted and have been complimented on my work on the heavy bag. My wife and me have done our share of traveling while we’ve been out west and still plan to move back east when the opportunity presents itself. I will definitely be seeing many of you when we return. Until then.\\nIt began with the best intentions. The days and weeks since my Neurology follow up had me feeling angry, lost and somewhat hopeless. I had mistakenly opened up to my doctor, therapist and wife that I had briefly thought of suicide, or commented on how I wished the original death notice I received when I was twelve would have ended me instead of prolonging my suffering through related issues. Falling down and not having the control you once had on your life it not easy to get used to. With that said and fully expressed, I had felt a positive shift in recent days that mad me feel as if I had turned a corner. I had all but stopped worrying about what I couldn’t do any more and started thinking about what I could. My intention was to share with my wife that the fear and negativity were behind me. That, whatever it took, I was going to be open minded and more constructive.\\n\\nAs I began to speak to her, I made a point to use the word “Positive”. This exchange was going to let her know that I was leaving behind the negativity and look at all the positives and embrace whatever changes might come. Before I even knew what was happening. Before she even had a chance to reply. She buried her head in my chest and began crying uncontrollably. I did my best to make her laugh and smile “Hey, there’s nothing to cry about. This is all about looking at things with a positive mindset.” “Come on, there’s no crying,” “I’m not crying.” She sniffled, as she reached for the nearby box of tissues. All I wanted to do was tell her how lucky I was to have two parents that loved me and a wife who, despite all my obvious faults, adored me. Still, she kept her head buried in my chest. Unconvincingly trying to conceal the fact that she had become overwhelmed with tears. “I have to pee.” She announced as she quickly made her way to the bathroom. Concerned for what she was feeling, I followed. More than anything, I wanted to comfort her. To let her know that it was okay to cry. Even with the door closed. I could hear her blowing her nose and washing the tears from her eyes. I entered and hugged her. Assuring her that, maybe for the first time since that hospital visit. That everything was going to be okay. That she could cry all she wanted to as long as she didn’t feel the need to hide it from me. “I was trying to tell you that I turned a corner and how I was feeling more positive about things.” “Why are you crying?” Still red in the face and filled with tears. She said something I never thought I’d ever hear. “Because it’s not your fault.” “You didn’t do anything wrong.” I have to say, it was humbling.\\nThroughout our entire marriage and even when we were dating. She was always the strong one. The rock, the ying to my yang, or whatever you call it. Being on the other side of the coin. The one to say “Don’t worry. No matter what happens, everything is going to be alright.” It was hard, but I feel it was long overdue. Whatever may come, I hope I can always be there for her when she needs it. Considering how much she’s done for me in reinforcing my health and assuring my happiness. I’ve got my work cut out for me.\\n\\nBelow are a couple of helpful links.', 'ELODIE SAMPERE and I are behind the bushes with our pants down.
